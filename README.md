# TweetAnalytics

Simple scrip app for analysis of tweets using [Text Analytics API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/text-analytics-api) and [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/). 

For now, the script analysises ~100 tweets that have word 'Samsung' in them and returns the average sentiment value. 

For running this script, first you have to acquire needed keys for accessing Text Analytics API and Twitter API. The process is easy and free. You need to install Tweepy (`easy_install tweepy`) and simply run 

`python run-analytics.py`

There's a few more things I plan to add, so stay tuned.
